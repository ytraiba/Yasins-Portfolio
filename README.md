# Yasin's Portfolio

The goal of this project was to create a personal website in which I could showcase my projects and receive any requests for freelance 
opportunities. I implemented animations using existing React libraries and scripted CSS. It's mobile-ready and scales to any screen size. 

## Dependencies & Libraries

* [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) 
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
